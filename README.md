# Marcelo Feliciano

Software engineer focused on designing, deploying, and operating **production-grade systems** in cloud environments.

I build reliable APIs and backend services with a strong emphasis on **correctness, predictability, and operational simplicity**. Most of my work is centered around **AWS-based architectures**, making explicit trade-offs between **performance, cost, and risk**.

I favor simple, well-understood solutions that are easy to reason about and operate in production.

- Proven technologies over novelty  
- Measure before optimizing  
- Production is the source of truth  
- Systems are designed assuming failure

Shipping working software is only the beginning. Keeping it running is the real job.
