# Hi, I'm Marcelo Feliciano

Senior Backend Engineer focused on designing, deploying, and operating production systems in cloud environments. I build reliable APIs and backend services with an emphasis on correctness, predictability, and operational simplicity. My work prioritizes clear trade-offs between performance, cost, and risk, primarily in AWS-based architectures.

I favor simple, well-understood solutions that remain easy to operate and reason about in production.

## What I Work On

- Backend architecture for transactional and API-driven systems  
- Operating production services: monitoring, incident response, troubleshooting  
- Designing stateless services with clear boundaries and low operational overhead  
- Making pragmatic architectural trade-offs
- Refactoring legacy systems safely in live environments

## Core Stack

**Languages:** Java (primary), TypeScript / Node.js, SQL  
**Frameworks:** Spring, NestJS  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, SQS, SNS, ALB, Lambda), Docker, Git, Maven

## Engineering Principles

- Clarity over cleverness  
- Proven technologies over novelty  
- Measure before optimizing  
- Production is the source of truth  
- Systems are designed assuming failure
